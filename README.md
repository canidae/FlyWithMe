# About
**FlyWithMe is in the process of being rewritten from an Android application to a web page, where the goal is to
make it well adapted not just to computers, but also devices like phones and tablets (aka.
[PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications)).
This will take some time, the application is currently in an alfa state.**

FlyWithMe is an application aimed at hangglider and paraglider pilots, that gathers flight site information from
[flightlog.org](https://flightlog.org/), and gives you easy access to weather forecasts from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/).

# Contributing
Pull requests are most welcome, but they must adhere to these rules:
* The contribution you provide must either be, or be compatible with the [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.
* FlyWithMe is [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licensed, obviously you must agree that your contribution will end up with this license.
* I will attribute you for your contribution, but it likely won't be more than a simple list, possibly not even visible in the application.
* Keep the pull requests small, don't fix or add multiple things in one pull request.
* Try to use the same coding style as already present in the source.
* I may, and likely will, alter the code you supply to suit my taste.

At some point I may set up a way for users to donate (money, preferably), as this project cost me a bit in server upkeep.
If I do, I'm unlikely to share the income with any contributors (sorry!), as I strongly doubt it will result in any
significant income worth sharing.

It is however my intention to keep this service free of charge, and free of ads.
