Bugs:
- Currently ~impossible to update takeoff data, we only read that file when database is created/upgraded
- Sharing doesn't work on all phones: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12230942/why-images-media-insertimage-return-null

Features:
- Refresh forecast button in forecast view
- Search after takeoffs (text in name or description)
- Push messages for schedule registrations
- Crawl flightlog (and possibly other sites with takeoff database), clients can download updates (or push messages)
- Height limits with airspace polygons
- Web page for those without Android to register/view schedule?
- When clicking on map icon while viewing a takeoff, zoom to takeoff on map?
